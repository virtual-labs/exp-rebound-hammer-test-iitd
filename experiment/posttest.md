B    30<br>
C    45<br>
D    25<br><br>

Q2. It is essential that the rebound hammer is held at aright angle to the tested surface to avoid:<br>

B    Material removal by chipping<br>
C    Partial transfer of energy to and from the hammer<br>
D    All of the above<br>

A    14<br>
B    7<br>
C    27<br>
**D    13**<br>


Q4. What is the minimum number of points to be tested on a specimen for

Q5. Identify the wrong statements
i. Rebound number increases with increase in the compressive strength of concrete.<br>
ii. Rebound number is independent of the type of aggregates used. <br>
iii. Strength of partially compacted concrete also bears a unique relationship to the rebound number.<br>
iv. A wet surface will give rise to overestimation of the strength of concrete calibrated under dry condition.<br>
v. The effect of age can be ignored for concrete over 14 days<br>
vi. Carbonated concrete gives an overestimation of strength of concrete<br>
vii. In general a higher rebound number is observed near the bottom of the concrete placement<br>
