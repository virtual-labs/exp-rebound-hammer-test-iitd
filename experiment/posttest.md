A 14 <br>
B 7 <br>
**C 27 <br>**
D 13 <br>

Q.2 What is the minimum number of points to be tested on a specimen for ?

Q.3 Identify the wrong statements
Rebound number increases with an increase in the compressive strength of concrete
Rebound number is independent of the type of aggregates used 
The strength of partially compacted concrete also bears a unique relationship to the rebound number
A wet surface will give rise to an overestimation of the strength of concrete calibrated under dry conditions.
The effect of age can be ignored for concrete over 14 days
Carbonated concrete gives an overestimation of the strength of concrete
In general, a higher rebound number is observed near the bottom of the concrete placement
 
A ii, iii, vi <br>
B iv, v, vi, vii <br>
**C ii, iii, iv <br>**
D ii, iii, iv, vi <br>
