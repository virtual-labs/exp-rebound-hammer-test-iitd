Identify the wrong statements (i) Rebound number increases with increase in the compressive strength of concrete (ii) Rebound number is independent of the type of aggregates used (iii) Strength of partially compacted concrete also bears a unique relationship to the rebound number (iv) A wet surface will give rise to overestimation of the strength of concrete calibrated under dry condition. (v) The effect of age can be ignored for concrete over 14 days (vi) Carbonated concrete gives an overestimation of strength of concrete (vii) In general a higher rebound number is observed near the bottom of the concrete placement",
